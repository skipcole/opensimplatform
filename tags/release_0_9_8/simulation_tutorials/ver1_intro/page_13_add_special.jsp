        <h2 align="left">Add Special Features</font></h2>
        <p align="left">Next Mike H. will begin adding the 'special features' 
          that his simulation will need. In describing the actors (what they can 
          and cannot do) we have already established the special features that 
          we will need.</p>
        <p align="left">Special features add the quantitative and collarborative 
          elements to a simulation that and can allow the computer to act as an 
          adjudicator. For example, if one wants to have an approaching problem, 
          say a growing rat population, one can add an integer variable to represent 
          the current number of rats. To help fight that and other problems, one 
          can assign the players budgets from which they can target money. Once 
          the players begin using their budgets to target certain problems, the 
          amount they spend may have either a formulaic response, or it it may 
          cause certain triggers to fire changing the world.</p>
        <p>All the while that these numeric things are going on (Rat population 
          rising or falling, GDP going up or down, businesses entering or leaving) 
          the players will continue to negotiate and work with each other.</p>
        <p>And yes, eventually, it will be possible to plug in under the covers 
          more a numeric model of 'the world.'</p>
