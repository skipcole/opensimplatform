      <ul>
        <li>The reason this is called a 'placeholder/image' page is because the 
          same type of page can be used for two different reasons.</li>
        <li>It can be used to add a section that contains an image file. Image 
          files, such as maps, can add a wealth of information to your simulation.</li>
        <li>It can also be used as a stub to indicate where additional functionality 
          is desired. It is envisioned that this tool will grow greatly with time, 
          and will grow in response to the desires of the people using it. So 
          allowing the creation of pages to show the functionality desired (such 
          as a specialized display of information or player control) can help 
          guide the development team. All people will need to do is 'photoshop' 
          in the page desired, and then speak with the developers about what they 
          want. </li>
