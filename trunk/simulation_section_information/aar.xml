  <description>An 'after action report' (AAR) is a document written after an event describing what happened and what the lessons learned were. Adding this section to a simulation adds a page showing the after action report that the instructor has written. This is generally considered the essential final step of a simulation: to provide feedback to the players on how they have done, and give them thoughts to reflect upon.</description>
