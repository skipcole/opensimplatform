      <h1>Vision Morsel 1: What a 'Simulation' is to us.</h1>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It seems that the term 'simulation' needs constant re-definition on 
          the list boards that we frequent. Actually we are using the word 'simulation' 
          is embody a whole host of concepts, so we will unpackage some of that 
          here.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr /></p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>'Simulation' = 'Training Simulation'</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>For us 'simulation' is short for 'training simulation.' This is to 
          say that a simulation is a training event that will hopefully leave 
          the participants changed in some meaningful way. They will be able to 
          see the world differently or perform better than if they had not conducted 
          training with the simulation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr /></p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>'Simulation' = 'Online Multi-Player Simulation' (For Now)</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The simulations we are creating at first will be multi-player. Including 
          multiple players allows for a richer experience than we can currently 
          provide with artificial intelligence (AI). This is not to say that we 
          will not be working to include more computer driven characters as the 
          state of the art of AI increases. But to get the best set of interactions 
          that we can provide to players now, humans will play the roles of all 
          of the actors.</p>
        <p>Since the simulations we are creating will be multi-player, it only 
          makes sense that they will be online. We want to keep the access to 
          the software as universal as possible, so it will be able to run in 
          a standard browser window.</p>
        <p></p>
        <hr /></p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>What Any Simulation Must Have</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>When one considers any simulation meant to have the influence we want 
          to have on players, the following is a list of essential abilities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Players will need to be presented background information on the 
            world in which they exist.</li>
          <li>Players will need to be presented background information the role 
            of the actor they play in that world.</li>
          <li>Players will need to be able to communicate with each other. </li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <hr /></p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>What Most Any Simulation Will Have</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>While the above conditions are necessary (and a simulation using only 
          them will be discussed in a future morsel) they are not sufficient for 
          many of the lessons one will want to teach. One of the limitations to 
          many role-playing simulations is that they lack hard constraints and 
          objective adjudication. These can be provided by also allowing the following 
          functionalities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Players will need to be able to make decisions.</li>
          <li>Players will need to be able to access data pertinent to the actor 
            they are playing.</li>
          <li>The computer will be able to 'crunch numbers' according to formula 
            that the simulation creator has selected and change simulation parameters 
            according to the results.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
        <hr />
      </h2>
      <h2>How will the simulations created be used?</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This will be up to the simulation creator. We provide a lot of flexibility 
          here. Simulations can be conducted:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Purely Online 
          <ul>
            <li>With all of the players online at the same time (synchronously)</li>
            <li>With the players logging on whenever they find convenient (asynchronously)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In a classroom</li>
        <li>Played in one session</li>
        <li>Played over many weeks or months</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote> 
        <p></p>
        <hr /></p>
        </blockquote>
      <h2>So what will the simulations being created look like?</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>While as this tool develops the basic look of it may change, some of 
          the data shown to players will probably always remain constant. Our 
          initial choice on how a simulation will look is shown below. A simulation 
          page will have some standard information at the top of each page. For 
          example, the name of the simulation, the name of the organization that 
          created, and the name of the actor that the player has been assigned 
          will all be shown at there at the top.</p>
        <p>Just below the constant information will be a set of tabs that allow 
          a player to move around between the different sections available to 
          them. A simulation section might contain a map, or a chart, or some 
          text, or a place where the player can make a decision. Essentially each 
          section allows a player to obtain more information or make a decision, 
          or both.</p>
        <p><img src="images/basic_page.png" width="687" height="450" /></p>
        <p>The set of tabs (simulation sections) availble to a player may change 
          as the simulation progresses. For example, if the simulation is in the 
          stage 'summer' then it might be possible for the actors to do and see 
          a different set of things than if the stage is 'winter.' We call these 
          different stages 'simulation phases'. The simulation creator will be 
          able to define whatever phases they want and provide the actors a different 
          set of tabs (simulation sections) for each.</p>
