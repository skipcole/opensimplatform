<h2>The Problem</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The world we live in is complex. Many things affect many other things and the solutions to problems
  are frequently not obvious. Some people may know the solutions, or have a part of the solution in their mind, but
  the true answers are spread out amid a sea of noise. We need to find a better way to help good answers become
  apparent and to disseminate them in a form that sticks. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Our current methods of conveying lessons (reading, talking and role playing) are strong. They have been used for
  millenium. But they do run up against limitations. The human mind is quite fallible and groups of people quite
  susceptible to believing what they want to believe. We need methods that force people to face, or at least consider,
  real world constraints. Fortunately for us, technology is now making possible methods that include our 
  traditional methods, and also incorporate hard, cold numerical facts.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>  A numerical represantation of the world is called a 'simulation.' We are
  positing that allowing people to experience simulated, or virtual, worlds can be a fast and effective method 
  to entrench lessons and build up the equivalent of real world experience. Even better, this experience is 
  gained in a risk free environment. (Mess up in a real world hostage negotiation, and one can end up <strong>dead</strong>. 
  Mess up in a virtual hostage negotiation, and one can end up <strong>embarrassed</strong>. We consider this 'risk free.')</p>
  <p> Another hallmark of our times is that training is ceasing to be a one way form of communication. 
  In a simpler world a group of people may have 'known' the answers. (They were frequently wrong, but lets let that 
  pass.) But in today's world the reality is that 'we are smarter than me.' So we also want a tool that allows 
  people to see all of the assumptions going into these simulations, and be able to provide meaningful feedback and 
  possibly even build simulations on top of the work of others.  </p>
  <p>With this tool we attend to accomplish all of this. </p>
  <hr />

  <p></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Can't this all be done using some other tool, like 'Second Life'?</h2>
<blockquote>
        <p>This tool, and the simulations created with it, emphasize strategic 
          thinking and the importance of relationships. While much can be learned 
          moving around in high fidelity 3D virtual worlds, many important lessons 
          cannot be effectively taught there. One serious limitation of these 
          worlds is that 1 minute = 1 minute. As Peter Senge points out in 'The 
          Fifth Discipline' humans are not good at learning when the effect comes 
          much later than the cause. Also, sometimes lessons simply just need 
          to be learned faster. The world seldom gives one, for example, six months 
          to prepare for a six-month tour.</p>
        <p>Another limitation, although not as serious, is that these 3-D worlds do 
          not usually present data in the boring old formats that strategic thinkers 
          throughout the ages have relied on. Boring old maps and charts are still 
          important ways to convey trends and help one make wise decisions. Little 
          is gained by 'looking over the shoulder' of one's avatar at charts in 
          a 3D world when those charts could just be simply displayed.</p>
  <p></p><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>An 'invisible technology'</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A technology becomes invisible when one doesn't even give it much consideration. 
    For example, electricity is an 'invisible' technology in most parts of the 
    world. We take for granted its availability. The ability to create simulations 
    will also some day be an invisible technology without a lot of 'awe' associated 
    with it. The sooner that day arrives, the better.</p>
  <p>We would like to enable all people to be able to use a simple wizard to create 
    multi-player online simulations. Currently this is still something that one 
    needs a fairly large budget, and programming help to do. The number of experts 
    involved in creating simulations is still a rather small set of people. By 
    enabling the subject matter experts direct access to putting their ideas in 
    this new medium, we will be able to draw out the wisdom from far more people, 
    and will be able to take the playing field to a higher level.</p>
  <p></p><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Our final trump card</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are other advantages to this system, but let us end with what is certainly 
    our strongest argument: this tool is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a>. As such it can always be 
    modified by anyone who needs it, and it can easily incorporate any of the 
    great new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a> products being made available every day. </p>
