      <blockquote> 
        <p>In this morsel we will discuss (at a very high level) the overall flow 
          of creating, running and sharing simulations using the USIP Online Simulation Platform (USIP OSCW). </p>

      <h2>Think</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This tool, or really any tool to aid instruction, pre-supposes that 
          the person using it has something meaningful to teach. We can't really 
          help you with this first step, but we have faith that you and many other 
          fine people will come forward with lessons they want to teach. (We will 
          describe some possible lessons in future morsels.)</p>

      <h2>Create</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The next step is to use the wizard to create a simulation. </p>
        <p><img src="images/vm2_2.png" width="602" height="172" /></p>
        <p>This can be broken down into these five steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter Background Material - The 'Simulation Creator' (SC) will use 
            the wizard to enter the background materials that the players will 
            need to read.</li>
          <li>Define Phases - Here the SC will consider how he or she envisions 
            the simulation progressing toward the end and define a phase for each 
            stage of play. This may be as simple as defining one phase for when 
            the simulation is in progress, and one for when the simulation is 
            completed: 'in progress' and 'done.'</li>
          <li>Create Actors - The SC will enter information particular to each 
            Actor involved in the simulation.</li>
          <li>Create Actions and Views - The SC will enter in what actors can 
            do and see. Many of these will involve what we call 'special features' 
            which we will discuss in a future morsel.</li>
          <li>Assign Actions and Views to Actors - The SC will then assign the 
            actions and views available to the different actors in the different 
            phases of the simulation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <hr />
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Play</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The next step is to conduct the simulation with a group of players. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/vm2_3.png" width="436" height="158" /></p>
        <p>This can be broken down into the four steps below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create Running Simulation - Give a specific name to a play session, 
            for example 'Beta-test 1' or 'Summer 2009 Session 1.'</li>
          <li>Create Users - Each player will need a login account to enter into 
            a simulation.</li>
          <li>Assign Users to Actors - Each player will need to be assigned to 
            an actor. For example, the player 'John Doe' may be playing the actor 
            'The President.'</li>
          <li>Invite Players to Begin - This enables players to login to play 
            the roles assigned to them and can (optionally) send them an email 
            to let them know that the simulation has begun.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Share</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>One can stop at step 3 above (or more likely go from 'play' back to 
          think'), but our sincere hope is that once educators have created good 
          simulations they will want to share these with others. </p>
        <p><img src="images/vm2_4.png" width="337" height="148" /></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Package Simulation - Take a simulation and package it for transport.</li>
          <li>Download / Upload from Web Site - Post a simulation to a community 
            web site where that simulation is relevant. For example, people creating 
            simulations around environmental themes may all be posting to one 
            site sponsored by members of the green community.</li>
          <li>Import Simulation - Take a simulation that someone else has created 
            and import it onto your system. You may be able to (depending an parameters 
            set by the original simulation creator) conduct, or even change then 
            conduct, the simulation with players of your choosing.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Bringing it all Together</h2>
      <p>Below is shown the entire process. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/vm2_final.png" width="720" height="387" /></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The steps here have been presented sequentially, but it is assumed 
          that in the real world things will move in a more iterative fashion 
          back and forth between areas. For example, after creating a simulation 
          and play testing it with some beta testers, one may return to the 'create' 
          stage to fine-tune it some more.</p>
