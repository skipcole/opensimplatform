      <blockquote> 
        <p>Seeing how the world looks from another person's point of view can 
          be a powerful experience. If we assume that experience drives one's 
          perception of the world, then a typical member of group A would probably 
          have the same attitudes as a typical member of group B, if only that 
          person had been born into group B. </p>
        <p>The world is filled with groups of people that do not understand each 
          other. Here we will be using the generic terms of 'group A' and 'group 
          B,' but feel free to switch this in your mind to whichever two groups 
          you like (Israeli and Palestinian, Farmer and Cattle-herder, Business 
          Person and Environmentalist, etc.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The goal of this online simulation is to give members of two groups 
          a deeper understanding of what it is like to be a member of the other 
          group. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Assumptions</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It is assumed that the simulation is conducted online, so the players 
          will not need to meet each other - the two players may come from groups 
          with a great deal of animosity between them.</p>
        <p>It is also assumed that the players have some material reason for playing. 
          They may be doing it for credit, they may be doing it for preparation 
          for negotiation, they may even be doing it for money (the small amounts 
          like those given for typical psychological experiments). It is not assumed 
          that they are doing it for fun. Seeing the world from another person's 
          point of view frequently requires a lot of mental work - and is not 
          fun. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>First Step: Defining the Two Worlds</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The simulation creator(s) will have to research and understand thoroughly 
          what it feels like to be a member of either group. Materials will have 
          to be developed that explain what it feels like to be a member coming 
          from the other group, and how their world is perceived. In fact, it 
          will probably be best if this material comes from two simulation creators, 
          one from group A and one from group B.</p>
        <p>In this simulation we envision there being two maps. Both will convey 
          the same physical terrain: the basic shape of the country will be the 
          same. But on top of the regular terrain will be indicated the memories 
          of the Actor being played. For example, on the map of the world as seen 
          by a member of group A, there may be the following additional 'emotional 
          landmarks':</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Place where members of group B beat my grandfather.</li>
          <li>Place where members of group B destroyed my school.</li>
          <li>Group B Checkpoint where my my friend Tony's father disappeared.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The map of the world for group B would contain similar types of landmarks.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Second Step: Give Them Something to Discuss</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The next step will be to create a focus of discussion for the two Actors 
          to talk about. It should be a small item, not the entire point of disagreement 
          between the two peoples, but may be a microcosm of the larger issues.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Defining Phases and Sections</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Once the above materials have been generated, using the USIP OSCW to 
          create the simulation will be easy. For this simulation there will be 
          three parties involved: Actor A, Actor B and Control. Fictional Actor 
          A will come from group A (and will be played by a real live person from 
          group B.) Fictional Actor B will come from group B. The Control actor 
          will be an impartial instructor.</p>
        <p>In the diagram below we show the simulation sections available to the 
          three actors in the two phases of the simulation. Essentially in this 
          simulation all that Actor A and B can do is read about their world and 
          chat with each other. The Control actor can also chat (but probably 
          will not) and can write the after action report and change the simulation 
          phase from 'in progress' to 'done' - effectively terminating the simulation.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Conducting the Simulation</h2>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>As previously indicated, when this simulation is conducted a member 
          of group B will play the role of the fictional Actor coming from group 
          A, and vice a versa. Control will monitor their exchanges (this is a 
          labor intensive simulation) and terminate it when the two characters 
          have come some agreement or understanding on the small, fictional point 
          of contention. Control will also be able to terminate the simulation 
          if the exchanges between the two players grow too acrimonious.</p>
        <p>Multiple sessions of this simulation can be used to help fine-tune 
          the scenario, the introductory materials and the maps. Unfortunately, 
          since this is such a simply constructed scenario - the players do not 
          have any specific decisions to make - the automatic collection of data 
          is limited. We will address ways to improve upon this in our next morsel.</p>
