        <p align="left">Mike H. will now create the actors (roles) that the players 
          will assume the roles of. Thinking through the interactions he would 
          like to see, and the lessons he would like the players to gain, he comes 
          up with the following set of initial actors:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>President - Desires the support of the business owner, but has very 
          little power other than by using the influence of his or her office.</li>
        <li>Legislator - Controls funds which can be (if desired) to be used to 
          fight the growing rat population.</li>
        <li>Business Owner - can see the rising rat population, and can give (or 
          take away) their support for the president.</li>
        <li>Control - The 'control' person will oversea the simulation, advancing 
          the round every 2 or 3 minutes depeding on how things are going. The 
          user playing the 'control' role will also write the 'after action report' 
          and mark a simulation done when it terminates.</li>
      </ul>
